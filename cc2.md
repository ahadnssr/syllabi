## Colonial and Anti-Colonial Epistemologies


![An "illustrated key" to Aliquot Heroun tattoos in *Admiranda narratio fida tamen, de commodis et incolarvm ritibvs Virginiæ* (1590) by Theodor de Bry (1528-1598)/ Thomas Harriot (1560-1621)/](/images/cc.png)

### Course Rationale

How do we understand the texts which produced, and were produced by, inequality, excess, violence and fear? When we speak of the canon of Enlightenment thinkers, those are not the most oft-used categories of understanding that we invoke. Yet, inequality – whether civilizational or theological or racial – and fear – whether of the “other” or of the “modern” – provide the background to the discursive traditions we are going to explore from texts roughly placed 1700-2000 CE. 

In the previous semester we saw that transmissions across geographies of ideas and peoples, make the notion of the "West" as a hermetically sealed unit untenable. This semester, the rise of mercantile and colonial corporation and the growth of African and Indigenous slave-labor as fuel for northern European economies is the necessary backdrop to the question of tradition and the emergence of the "New". 

This semester will focus on the emergence of disciplinary thought. The texts we read this semester were often foundational in creating or enlarging academic disciplines (alongside political and social systems). We will look at the birth of Philology, History, Anthropology and Natural Sciences as disciplinary knowledges-- and the colonial imperative of such epistemologies. In the second half of the semester we will look at how these epistemologies were then resisted against by the colonized world. Watch this scene from [Black Robe (1991) on  colonial epistemologies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoxUto7-sDI). To understand the question of 'barbarism' at play there, recall Bartolomé de Las Casas, *Apologética Historia Sumaria* (c.1552). México: Universidad Autónoma de  México, 1967, vol. II, pp. 637–54.


### To Be Read during the Break
Please read these two essays over the break; and post your response to them in Piazza. Our first class will be a discussion of these essays. They are available in CW/Files&Resources.

* Arundhati Roy, "Capitalism: A Ghost Story" (2014) 
* Nancy Scheper-Hughes, "Ishi's Brain, Ishi's Ashes: Anthropology and Genocide" *Anthropology Today*, Vol. 17, No. 1 (Feb., 2001), pp. 12-18 (1998) and [UC Berkeley looks back on dark history, abuse of Yahi man 106 years later](http://www.dailycal.org/2017/09/01/uc-berkeley-looks-back-on-dark-history-abuse-of-yahi-man-106-years-later/).


### Assessments

We want to build a community of readers and thinkers in this class - who are able to work collectively and collaboratively. I am setting my assessment goals on two paths: firstly, I want to make sure we are doing close-reading of the texts, and secondly, I want to ensure that we are critical and engaged writers. With those goals, I ask that you do two forms of regular writing in the class - short form and research oriented. There will be only one long form paper. 

* **20 points for Participation**: To get the full points, you will attend every single class, and be an active listener to your colleagues, and sometimes, a commenter and facilitator for their ideas and sometimes, a speaker of your own thoughts. 
* **10 points for RBML Archive Report**: As part of your exposure to the world of CC, you are to visit the RBML at Columbia. Locate and check out a manuscript belonging to/related to one of the authors on our syllabus and write a 600 word response where you describe the search, the archival object, your analysis of the materiality and content of the archival object.
* **15 points for Presentation on Text/Author**: Every class, one student will deliver a short-presentation on the Text/Author we are reading. The presentation will highlight their biography, their intellectual concerns and contributions, and some recent assessment of their thought in scholarly literature (JSTOR searches limited to past 5 years). This presentation will be posted on Piazza before the class begins. Expect to invest around 10 hours of research, writing and prepration for this presentation. The presentation cannot last more than 15 minutes.
* **25 points for Presentations on Context/Time**: Every class, one student will deliver a short-presentation on the context for the Text/Author we are reading. This context will comprise of 10 headlines (only) selected from newspapers contemporary to the Text/Author. You can use the Historical Newspaper databases on Clio. This presentation will be posted on Piazza before the class begins. Expect to invest around 10 hours of research, writing and prepration for this presentation. The presentation cannot last more than 15 minutes.
* **15 points for Discussion on Piazza**: For your comment/discussions on the Piazza posts of your colleagues after the class. 
* **15 points for a final paper on Euclid's theorem**: All semester we have been talking about the history of the birth of the discipline. We are now undergoing the birth of a new discipline-- Data Science-- which rests on "Big Data", AI/Machine Learning. In your final paper, I ask that you bring the insights you have gathered from the rest of the course to write 1500 words on [Euclid's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm) and how it gave birth to this modern discipline. 
  

### Participation

Attendance and participation is required. Class participation requires your active participation. Some basic rules: come to class on time, do not disrupt the class, put your phones on silent, turn off all computing devices. As a discussion seminar, this course survives only if you come to every class, and participate by doing the readings, listening and commenting in class, turning in the assignment and seeing me during my office hours. Discussion means attentive and respectful listening, short and timely speaking, and creating a cordial and warm atmosphere wherein all are invited to test their ideas and impressions. Please read everything before class. Take notes in the margins of the text; underline key sentences and paragraphs, annotate; write out what feels extraordinary, questionable, pleasant, or remarkable (and remark it out loud in class).

#### Please Note the Core Policy on Student Attendance:

“Students are expected to attend every session of their Core classes. Students who miss class without instructor permission should expect to have their grade lowered. Repeated unexcused absences will result in a failing grade or a withdrawal from the class. In the event that a student must miss a class due to religious observance, illness, or family emergency, instructors may strongly encourage (though not require) that students complete additional assignments to help make up for lost class participation. Whenever possible (in the case of religious holidays, for example), students should provide advance notification of absence.

### Plagiarism and Academic Dishonesty Policy:

Columbia College is dedicated to the highest ideals of integrity in academia. Therefore, in Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization, any instance of academic dishonesty, attempted or actual, will be reported to the faculty chair of the course and to the dean of the Core Curriculum, who will review the case with the expectation that a student guilty of academic dishonesty will receive the grade of “F” in the course and be referred to dean’s discipline for further institutional action.
