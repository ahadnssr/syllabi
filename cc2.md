#Colonial and Anti-Colonial Epistemologies#


![An "illustrated key" to Aliquot Heroun tattoos in *Admiranda narratio fida tamen, de commodis et incolarvm ritibvs Virginiæ* (1590) by Theodor de Bry (1528-1598)/ Thomas Harriot (1560-1621)/](/images/cc.png)

###Course Rationale###

How do we understand the texts which produced, and were produced by, inequality, excess, violence and fear? When we speak of the canon of Enlightenment thinkers, those are not the most oft-used categories of understanding that we invoke. Yet, inequality – whether civilizational or theological or racial – and fear – whether of the “other” or of the “modern” – provide the background to the discursive traditions we are going to explore in the second part of CC. 

In the previous semester we saw that transmissions across geographies of ideas and peoples, make the notion of the "West" as a hermetically sealed unit untenable. This semester, the rise of mercantile and colonial corporation and the growth of African and Indigenous slave-labor as fuel for northern European economies is the necessary backdrop to the question of tradition and the emergence of the "New". The mobility of people, goods and ideas along networks of capital and the translations of concepts of being human and being free will be our main focus. We will look at the birth of Philology, History, Anthropology and Natural Sciences as disciplinary knowledges  - and the colonial imperative of such epistemologies. In the second half of the semester we will look at how these epistemologies were then resisted against by the colonized world.[^Watch this scene from Black Robe (1991) on  colonial epistemologies: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoxUto7-sDI] 

This semester, our section is participating in a pilot program which intends to promote cross-sectional conversation and dialogue. In a cluster of sections, we will share the same online platform where students and instructors can see the conversations happening in the other sections. Once a month, the sections will respond together to a single prompt
online, and have a in-person party where we can all mingle together.  This monthly gathering (three total for the semester) will be a chance to extend the classroom, while enjoying a fun evening. Dialogue, discussion and public debate is a core part of CC texts - these activities are modulated in our real lives across various mediums and social settings. This program
is our collective effort to model these texts and the diverse worlds we make with them.

### To Be Read during the Break ###
Please read these two essays over the break; and post your response to them in Piazza. Our first class will be a discussion of these essays. They are available in CW/Files&Resources.

* Arundhati Roy, "Capitalism: A Ghost Story" (2014)
* Partha Chatterjee, "Five Hundred Years of Fear and Love" (1998)


### Assessments ###
We want to build a community of readers and thinkers in this class - who are able to work collectively and collaboratively. I am setting my assessment goals on two paths: firstly, I want to make sure we are doing close-reading of the texts, and secondly, I want to ensure that we are critical and engaged writers. With those goals, I ask that you do two forms of regular writing in the class - short form and research oriented. There will be only one long form paper. 

* 20 points for Participation: To get the full points, you will attend every single class, and be an active listener to your colleagues, and sometimes, a commenter and facilitator for their ideas and sometimes, a speaker of your own thoughts. 
* 15 points for 3C: We will participate in a cross-sectional conversation this semester with two other CC sections. There will be three Questions (3Qs) which will unite us together once a month. You will get full points for winning the arguments for our section. This is a collaborative activity with your colleagues in our class. A handout with details will be circulated.
* 10 points for Presentation on Text/Author: Every class, one student will deliver a short-presentation on the Text/Author we are reading. The presentation will highlight their biography, their intellectual concerns and contributions, and some recent assessment of their thought in scholarly literature (JSTOR searches limited to past 5 years). This presentation will be posted on Piazza before the class begins. 
* 10 points for Presentations on Context/Time: Every class, one student will deliver a short-presentation on the context for the Text/Author we are reading. This context will comprise of 10 headlines (only) selected from newspapers contemporary to the Text/Author. You can use the Historical Newspaper databases on Clio. This presentation will be posted on Piazza before the class begins
* 5 points for Discussion on Piazza: For your comment/discussions on the Piazza posts of your colleagues after the class.  
* 30 points for Final Paper on Film - 3000 words. 

### Participation ###

Attendance and participation is required. Class participation requires your active participation. Some basic rules: come to class on time, do not disrupt the class, put your phones on silent, turn off all computing devices. As a discussion seminar, this course survives only if you come to every class, and participate by doing the readings, listening and commenting in class, turning in the assignment and seeing me during my office hours. Discussion means attentive and respectful listening, short and timely speaking, and creating a cordial and warm atmosphere wherein all are invited to test their ideas and impressions. Please read everything before class. Take notes in the margins of the text; underline key sentences and paragraphs, annotate; write out what feels extraordinary, questionable, pleasant, or remarkable (and remark it out loud in class).

#### Please Note the Core Policy on Student Attendance: ####

“Students are expected to attend every session of their Core classes. Students who miss class without instructor permission should expect to have their grade lowered. Repeated unexcused absences will result in a failing grade or a withdrawal from the class. In the event that a student must miss a class due to religious observance, illness, or family emergency, instructors may strongly encourage (though not require) that students complete additional assignments to help make up for lost class participation. Whenever possible (in the case of religious holidays, for example), students should provide advance notification of absence.

### Plagiarism and Academic Dishonesty Policy: ###

Columbia College is dedicated to the highest ideals of integrity in academia. Therefore, in Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization, any instance of academic dishonesty, attempted or actual, will be reported to the faculty chair of the course and to the dean of the Core Curriculum, who will review the case with the expectation that a student guilty of academic dishonesty will receive the grade of “F” in the course and be referred to dean’s discipline for further institutional action.
