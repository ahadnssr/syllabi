Our greater aim is to "understand the human condition" through our engagement with a certain corpus of texts.

In our first semester, we looked critically at the notion of the “canon” imbedded in the title “Masterpieces” for LitHum. I want to continue our conversation into the literary texts we read this semester, but I want to shift our focus from the texts to the selves.
This semester our over-arching theme will be the question of Subjectivity - the “I”, the "he, she, they, them", the "you", the "one". We will collectively read and think through how literary texts create a link to affective registers within us. We will think about how we identify ourselves through these texts, or without them? The question of subjectivity is important precisely because it forces us to think about privilege, marginality, locus of thought and focus of action. Whose bodies think, whose write, on whose flesh texts are inscribed, on whom they are rendered as law. The sacral self that is saved by Faith or the slave's body that is transported across oceans is tied in our texts. Similar entanglements point to the how feminine voices remain unheard, how alterity remains hidden when we encounter these canonical texts in the contemporary moment.
We will examine violence and coersion in advancing a collective reading through the texts. The questions we will raise about how the self is constituted in these texts, what interiorities it inhabits and to what political and aesthetic purpose, will help us link the production of these "masterpieces" to their historical and historiographic contexts. In that vein, we will focus on the history of book itself - of material production, economies of readers and circulation to see how the self and the world are connected.
To begin our conversation, I want you to read two texts during the break. The first is a short testimony by French philosopher and writer Maurice Blanchot (1907-2003) L'instant de ma mort (The Instant of My Death, 1994.) The second is the testimony of American poet and novelist Langston Hughes (1902-1967) in front of the Senate Permanent Subcomittee on Investigations of the Committee on Government Operations (a.k.a. McCarthy Committee) in 1953.
