## Course Overview

Our greater aim is to "understand the human condition" through our engagement with a certain corpus of texts.

In our first semester, we looked critically at the notion of the “canon” imbedded in the title “Masterpieces” for LitHum. I want to continue our conversation into the literary texts we read this semester, but I want to shift our focus from the texts to the selves.

This semester our over-arching theme will be the question of Subjectivity - the “I”, the "he, she, they, them", the "you", the "one". We will collectively read and think through how literary texts create a link to affective registers within us. We will think about how we identify ourselves through these texts, or without them? The question of subjectivity is important precisely because it forces us to think about privilege, marginality, locus of thought and focus of action. Whose bodies think, whose write, on whose flesh texts are inscribed, on whom they are rendered as law. The sacral self that is saved by Faith or the slave's body that is transported across oceans is tied in our texts. Similar entanglements point to the how feminine voices remain unheard, how alterity remains hidden when we encounter these canonical texts in the contemporary moment.

We will examine violence and coersion in advancing a collective reading through the texts. The questions we will raise about how the self is constituted in these texts, what interiorities it inhabits and to what political and aesthetic purpose, will help us link the production of these "masterpieces" to their historical and historiographic contexts. In that vein, we will focus on the history of book itself - of material production, economies of readers and circulation to see how the self and the world are connected.

To begin our conversation, I want you to read two texts during the break. The first is a short testimony by French philosopher and writer Maurice Blanchot (1907-2003) *L'instant de ma mort* (The Instant of My Death, 1994.) The second is the testimony of American poet and novelist Langston Hughes (1902-1967) in front of the Senate Permanent Subcomittee on Investigations of the Committee on Government Operations (a.k.a. McCarthy Committee) in 1953.

## Assessments

You will be assessed on the following criteria:
* Participation: 20 points
* Final Conference: 25 points DUE APRIL 15 & 24
* Two Individual Presentations: 20 points
* History of the Book Essay: 30 points DUE APRIL 1st
Final Exam: 5 points
 

Participation: This means perfect attendance, excellent listening and communication skills in class; the capacity to focus and encourage dialogue with your peers; respectful and thoughtful interactions. I will assign "out of class" events which you can attend to get credit towards your participation grade.

Final Conference: You will participate in a thematic conference, that you will self-organize and present as a class. You are asked to work closely with your peers in creating, researching and presenting the ideas for papers and panels. As a collaborative project, this is an exercise designed to showcase your capacity to think and work with your peers. I will ask each person in the panel to grade everyone else (in confidence). I will utilize those grades in my own assessments. Along with the oral presentation, you will submit the script/pamphlet/handout/powerpoint etc that you produce for grading. More details forthcoming.

Individual Presentation: You will lead the class with a 10 minute presentation on the text under discussion. This is done by a sign-up sheet at the beginning of the semester. Your individual presentation should provide historical and literary context of the work, as well as its material and circulation histories. It should contain three specific discussion questions which you will moderate in the class for 10 minutes. Each student will do two individual presentations.

Essay: The "History of the Book" essay will delve into the worlds in which texts come to life. You will choose one of the texts included in the Syllabi and research where and when it was written, where it was first published, by whom, how many editions, what were the circulation numbers, and what were the earliest reviews, where were the reviews published and finally, where was the text cited and quoted. You must utilize the help of a subject librarian at Butler to organize your research. This assignment is 1500-2000 words.  You can read an example (but done over a whole book!) of what I expect by reading this sample chapter from Dietrich Bonhoeffer's *Letters and Papers from Prison: A Biography*. -- M.E Marty
