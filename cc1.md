## Introduction to Contemporary Civilization in the West, Part I: Knowing Worlds

Our central concern this semester will be confront the "canon" as an epistemological category. Over this year, you are asked to think about political thought and moral philosophy through the rubric of “the Great Books”? Who or what makes them “Great” and for whom and for what purpose? How do we interpret this "canon”? What is the relationship between the “canon” and its own historical context? Most importantly, what is the relationship between our social, cultural and intellectual presents to our interpretation of this canon? These questions will inform our approach to the many texts we will encounter in CC. 

We will approach these texts with an intellectual openness-– first by attempting to “see things their way” and next by tracing the meanings such texts can provoke in various historical presents. This will help us avoid the trap that these texts form a singular set of meanings or values about our present and guide us away from any hegemonic accounts of the texts.

As a historian of intellectual traditions in the “non-West,” I will highlight the ways in which textual transmissions across geographies and traditions remain intertwined and imbricated throughout human past. I foreground the text and I ask that we read it both to get a fair understanding of the issues and mentalities present in the text but also to raise the basic set of concerns within the text to our own political and public lives (note that this is distinct from asking the question of the relevance of the present to our pasts). Our effort must to be try and raise what it means to think critically and ethically not just in these “canonical” texts but in our experiential existence.

As we raise to critical light the rubric of "civilization" we will do so with regards to what constitutes the category "West". Hence, this course has additional readings spanning Sanskrit, Persian and Arabic medieval political thought. We will pay close attention to the intersections of these literary cultures with Greek and Latin. We will read more than your average CC section, but we will enjoy greater rewards than your average CC section.


## Required Work

### Written Work:

There are four short papers for this class. You will be given a concept to research and write within 48 hours. All papers must be emailed by the end of the due date. Please ensure that you are actually attaching the paper. Use either .doc or .pdf or .txt format for the files. Late papers will not be accepted. There are no mid-terms or finals. In addition, you will be asked to a material object paper and a manuscript paper.


### Participation:

Class participation requires your active participation. Some basic rules: come to class on time, do not disrupt the class, put your phones on silent, turn off all computing devices. As a discussion seminar, this course survives only if you come to every class, and participate by doing the readings, listening and commenting in class, turning in the assignment and seeing me during my house hours. All of this constitutes 10% of your grade.
Discussion means attentive and respectful listening, short and timely speaking, and creating a cordial and warm atmosphere wherein all are invited to test their ideas and impressions.
Please read everything before class. Take notes in the margins of the text; underline key sentences and paragraphs, annotate; write out what feels extraordinary, questionable, pleasant, or remarkable (and remark it out loud in class).
Attendance and participation is required.

#### Please note the Core Policy on Student Attendance:

“Students are expected to attend every session of their Core classes. Students who miss class without instructor permission should expect to have their grade lowered. Repeated unexcused absences will result in a failing grade or a withdrawal from the class. In the event that a student must miss a class due to religious observance, illness, or family emergency, instructors may strongly encourage (though not require) that students complete additional assignments to help make up for lost class participation. Whenever possible (in the case of religious holidays, for example), students should provide advance notification of absence.

#### Plagiarism and Academic Dishonesty Policy: 

Columbia College is dedicated to the highest ideals of integrity in academia. Therefore, in Literature Humanities and Contemporary Civilization, any instance of academic dishonesty, attempted or actual, will be reported to the faculty chair of the course and to the dean of the Core Curriculum, who will review the case with the expectation that a student guilty of academic dishonesty will receive the grade of “F” in the course and be referred to dean’s discipline for further institutional action.
