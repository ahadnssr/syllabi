The "Literature Humanities" core at Columbia invokes a series of questions, in order to provoke a dialogue, a discussion and a conversation which stretches across the first year.
Let us begin with some of those basic questions:

Why read the “Great Books”? Who or what makes them “Great” and for whom and for what purpose? Why did these particular texts embody the specific genealogy for Europe? When did this occur? What are the epistemological, ontological stakes in reading these "Great Books"? And what about pleasure, aesthetics, and erotics as hermeneutical categories of engagement?

We recognize that the aims of a "Common Core" have evolved continually since its inception in 1919 – from "Colloquium of Important Books" to "Humanities A" to its present form where it engages with a range of literary texts from the European cultural past. We recognize that one specific aim we will also embrace is to "understand the human condition" through our engagement with these texts.

As a historian of intellectual traditions in the South Asia, my effort will be to highlight the aesthetic and narrative intertwining across distinct geographies, within this body of literature. I will ask you to read closely and carefully and look for spaces, traces, hints and characterizations of broader worlds, of closer connections. I will raise a set of concerns about narrative worlds within and outside of these texts: concerns about gender, about power, about worldliness, about aesthetics. I will ask you to bring your own concerns to these texts. We will use these as a basis to open conversations and modes of engagement with the text.

We will begin our conversation with two essays debating what it means to read "World Literature", to encounter "Canon", to imagine worlds which are far removed materially, temporally and physically from us, but remain imaginatively abreast with us.

The first essay is by noted literary critic Frederic Jameson entitled "Third-World Literature in the Era of Multinational Capitalism" (1986) and the second is a critical response to it by Marxist theorist Aijaz Ahmad entitled "Jameson's Rhetoric of Otherness and the 'National Allegory' (1987). These essays will direct us towards a critical engagement not only to the texts we are reading but to our own subject-positions as readers.

From such a situated vantage point, we will launch an effort to answer those sets of basic questions over the semester. We will focus on a "Big Idea" (or "theme", if you will) and a "Big Question" (or "analytical perspective", if you will) for analyzing the broad variety of texts before us. My "Big Idea" is to highlight "Other Worlds" in these texts to you. These are representation of "the Other" - as adversaries, as conquests, as imagined, as projected. These are representations of "Worlds" which are new or different or far or in contention. I will ask us to see how these variety of texts inhabit, within them, distinct selves and ways of seeing. With that in mind, we will collectively answer, my Big Question: "Why do we need to construct an Other - to what political, social or cultural purpose? Similarly, I will ask you, in your work to present to me, and to the class, your own Big Idea, and your Big Question.

This progression of your own idea, your reading of texts will provide an anchor and a thread through the diverse readings of the seminar.

* A 500 word-count prospectus paper outlining your theme, worth 10% of the grade. Due Tuesday, September 24th.

* A 1000 word-count close-textual analysis on your theme, worth 30% of the grade. Due Thursday, Oct 24th.

* A 1200 word-count critical analysis essay across several texts on your theme, worth 30% of the grade. Due Tuesday, December 3rd. This final essay will include a short bibliography (Chicago Style) and appropriate footnotes (where applicable). All papers will be uploaded to CourseWorks. Late papers can be emailed to me but will receive penalties (

* Examination: There will be a final exam worth 10% of the grade
