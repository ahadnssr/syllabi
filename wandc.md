## Walking & Colonialism, 17th to the 19th century
Manan Ahmed

 
### Course Description

This course examines the ways in which knowledge of a particular space was constructed over time and for a particular effort. The relationship of cartography, ethnography and the construction of colonial edifices and artifacts of power and violence will be the background to our studies. Our aim is to examine two central issues: the production of knowledge and historical memory about the colonial world, and the agency of those engaged in such productions.

As Michel de Certeau notes in *The Practice of Everyday Life*, “the story begins on ground level, with footsteps,” so too we will begin to look at the “experiential history” of walkers in the Orient. There is a rich literature, starting with Walter Benjamin, to François Augoyard and Tim Ingold on the politics and sociality of walking in the urban milieu. Similarly, there is a long tradition of thinking through travel narratives as constructions of ‘outsider gaze’ onto the Orient. What the course attempts to do is to highlight the phenomenological connection between walking and knowledge about the Orient in the colonial context. This links the landscape, the space, the walker, and the reader of the account in a unique relationship of intimacy-– the walker to the landscape and the reader to the experience-– between the colonial agent and the colonized space. The question of power-– who gets to walk where-– is never more acute than when walkers enacted knowledge production step-by-step.

We will look at a series of figures of “walked” over Orient and Occident and we will see the ways in which the created/shaped forms of knowledge and the means to which their words served. We will also conduct walks in New York.

The course will begin with a theoretical survey of the production of experiential knowledges about the self and other within imperial and colonial contexts-– we will read selections from Virginia Woolf, Edward Said, Rebecca Solnit, Tim Ingold, Walter Benjamin, Michel de Certeau, and Timothy Mitchell. We will then focus on specific historical figures-– such as Thomas Coryat (1577-1617), Henry Blount (1602-1682), William Moorcroft (1767-1825), Richard F. Burton (1821-1890), Wilfred Thesiger (1910-2003) and Rory Stewart (1973 -).

### Walks in NYC

**Walk # 1**

[Map of the Walk](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=zs6KOaeSfSdE.knkxMvFBQ7MI&usp=sharing)

Our first walk will carry the theme of "pilgrimage" to go along with the reading of Benjamin of Tudela *Itinerary*. Similarly we will carry out a pilgrimage of our own, with three sacred sites as our visitations. You can also read about medieval pilgrimage of [Price](http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/sacredtexts/mparis.html). Our first stop will be Grant's [Tomb at 125th](http://www.nyc-architecture.com/HAR/HAR008.htm). We will then continue up Broadway to Audobon Hall where Malcolm X was [assassinated](http://maap.columbia.edu/place/240). We will continue further Broadway (which was originally the Wickquasgeck Trail) until we reach the Inwood Hill Park. The site there is the last vestiges of the Lenape people in Manhattan and their [memory](http://myinwood.net/the-indian-caves-of-inwood-hill-park/) is only available through [colonial memories](http://myinwood.net/inwoods-indian-life-reservation/). There is a fourth stop (right before the subway) that I will let you discover. 


**Walk # 2**

The theme of the second walk is the merchant empire of Manhattan and its connection to the knowledge-making enterprise of nineteenth century 'exploration'. We will start with John Jacob Astor-- the first "Millionaire American", financier of Lewis-Clarke Expedition as well as the founder of the NYPL. We will start at Astor Place in Village and go down to Battery Park via Mott Street. Check out the folder Chinatown-Opium in Files & Resources and also read about the [1849 Astor Riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astor_Place_Riot) and about John Jacob Astor's [trade](http://www.historynet.com/john-jacob-astor-wealthy-merchant-and-fur-trader.htm) and [practices](http://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/astoria--john-jacob-astor-and-thomas-jeffersons-lost-pacific-empire-by-peter-stark/2014/03/21/61c53796-a2dd-11e3-a5fa-55f0c77bf39c_story.html)-- as well as his foundation of the [NYPL](http://www.nypl.org/help/about-nypl/history)
