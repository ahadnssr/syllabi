##Shorthand Guide to my Pedagogy##

**Shape the syllabus**: My courses have a distinct argument framing my intellectual concern, question or field of inquiry. I am very explicit and detailed about the Assessments-- I believe in doing micro-assessments throughout the course and releasing the grades immediately. Transparency in grading and assessment is key to creating a sustainable and productive relationship. 

**Frame the frame**: I am eager to discuss historiography alongside history, including critically, my own scholarly tradition. Similarly, I began every class’s discussion by asking students to re-call and re-assess their previous experience from the last class. What stuck with them, and why? I also bring in insights on power, race, gender and class insofar as they intersect with questions of learning. It helps to be meta about the instruction as well as the class to make improve the student's learning. 

**Space**: I believe in spatial pedagogy. As much as possible, I move students around: by organizing in a circle, taking the class outside, small group work. I also use my body in different ways– sitting or standing in different corners. It keeps the classroom discussion fluid.

**Pick your paragraph**: I ask that, for every class, students pre-pick a particular passage (of their own concerns) and be prepared to share that passage with the class, and discuss how they interpret it, if and when called upon. This becomes a tool for creating a community of interpreters. It also ensures that students have a concrete footing in the class. 

**Theory Talk**: I respect and believe in the intelligence of my students. They can handle any critical and analytical language that I may wish to deploy. I often give names of theorists, or put up readings to follow up for students. I have never been disappointed by their engagement. Raising the bar of engagement is fruitful for me and for them.

**Writing**: I do small informal in-class writing the first day, once or twice in the middle, and at the end. “Take a piece of paper and write down how you would teach this class” was something I gave the first day of my history survey. These are un-graded, and I do not return them. But it helps me promote spontaenity, and also see the level of thinking and writing for each student. 

**Creative Assignments**: Pre-packaged assignments are boring for everyone involved. I use material culture, close reading, visual analysis, digital essays, walks, site-visits, newspaper hunts and video-essays. I do in-class group work very regularly to create lateral connections among the students. 

**Feedback**: I believe that mid-semester feedback (anonymous via Google Forms) is very very effective way to do a course-correction. I ask specific questions about class participation and assessment techniques. I give my own feedback either as written comments or (my preference) in a one-on-one meeting. I always aim to improve the strongest parts of the student's work and ask them to rely on university wide services (writing center etc.) should they face difficulties. I make sure I am clear that I highly respect and appreciate the work of pedagogy and encourage their usage of such resources.
