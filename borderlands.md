#### Course Bio: ####
>What is the violence of a line drawn upon a map? or on a terrain? How are people produced by such mapping? What anxieties drive the imperial cartographic impulse? What pressures does *terra nullis* exert *in situ*? What do the bodies produced in mapped territories look like? What bodies exist in unmapped terrains? What is the relationship between wonder, amazement, and control, annihilation? Where do we locate ourselves as scholars reading these maps? What maps are visible when we visit the landscape? How are narratives produced against maps? How are histories made visible in terrain?

>These questions will guide us as we traverse a theoretical terrain of writings on space and territory, and situate ourselves in specific historical moments of imperial mastery over space. We will cover a lot of ground temporally (focusing largely on mid-17th and mid-18th c) but our geographic focus will be continental America and sub-continental India. 
>As part of the exercise to think spatially about power and violence, the seminar will have a Geographic Informational Science (G.I.S.) Lab attached to it. We will learn the techniques and tools of making maps, and our exercises will allow us to create our own arguments about thinking spatially. No prior technical skills are needed for this course - except for the skill of close-reading. 

####Assessment:####
* 20% - Blog/Postings/Participation - on Piazza
* 20% - Leading discussion in Class
* 10% - Paired-Response Papers 
* 30% - GIS Project
* 10% - GIS Project Documentation
* 10% - Visual Essay

>We aim to focus on digital humanities and cooperative work in this seminar, and our assessment will reflect that. The majority of written work will be done in a forum/discussion space where you will be writing for your peers. The effort here will be to write quickly; to write clearly; and to write with the intention of illuminating the discussed text. You will also co-write and co-present to give you a sense of how cooperative work can integrate intellectual property as well as collective clarity. Our digital work will also be collective, though, we will produce individual *argumentative* maps.

###GIS Begins

* Google Earth (http://earth.google.com) (both PC and Mac; note that this will take a while to install because it's a big file.). Start with this [lesson](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/googlemaps-googleearth)

* [QGIS](http://qgis.org) (both PC and Mac). Start with this [instructions page](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/qgis-layers) at Programming Historian. For QGIS, you need to have some plug-ins installed as well. Coordinate, Georeferencer, OpenLayers, and Points2One.
 
* [Grass GIS](http://grass.osgeo.org) & [video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/user/GRASSGISNEWS/videos?view=0)
